<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power plant market types include dry steam stations, flash steam power stations, and binary cycle stations. Dry steam stations utilize steam directly from geothermal reservoirs to drive turbines. Flash steam power stations depressurize high-pressure hot water, turning part of it into steam to generate electricity. Binary cycle stations transfer heat from geothermal water to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, allowing the secondary fluid to vaporize and drive the turbine. Each type offers unique efficiency and application advantages.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Plant Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Power Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Power Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal power plant market encompasses three primary types of systems: dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle power stations. Dry steam power stations utilize steam directly from geothermal reservoirs to drive turbines. Flash steam power stations extract high-pressure hot water from the ground, allowing it to "flash" into steam as pressure decreases, powering turbines. Binary cycle power stations transfer heat from geothermal fluids to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, facilitating energy generation without direct steam use. Each system efficiently harnesses geothermal resources for sustainable energy production.</p></p>
